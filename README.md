# Credit Card Fraud Detection

# Object
The objective of this project to classify the credit card fraud detection. Basically 'Class' variable is the target variable.

# Challenges 

This dataset is used to detect the credit card fraud detection. This is a classification problem. This is an imbalanced dataset based on target variable. So In this Project, I will use encoding and decording techniques to balanced dataset.

These are various techniques as follows -
 - 1. Cross Validation Like KFOLD and Hyperparameter Tuning (Logistics Regression )
 - 2. Ensemble Technique - Random Forest
 - 3. Under Sampling
 - 4. Over Sampling
 - 5. SMOTETomek
 - 6. Ensemple Technique - EasyEnsembleClassifier


# Libraries 

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. sklearn
6. ibmlearn


# Commands

pip install imblearn

or 

pip install imbalanced-learn

# Dataset 

You have to download Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (CSV File) from Kaggle.
