# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This dataset is used to detect the credit card fraud detection. This is a classification problem. This is an imbalanced dataset based on target variable. So In this Project, I will use encoding and decording techniques to balanced dataset.

These are various techniques as follows -
 - 1. Cross Validation Like KFOLD and Hyperpaqrameter Tuning (Logistics Regression )
 - 2. Ensemble Technique - Random Forest
 - 3. Under Sampling
 - 4. Over Sampling
 - 5. SMOTETomek
 - 6. Ensemple Technique - EasyEnsembleClassifier
